# Python_Snake_Game

Yes Yes Yes, the snake in this game is a python.

This is a my version of the python snake game that I have learnt from the YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD4qAhfFuLo

It have a slight improve in the computation. 

This code is actually not that suitable for beginners as it involves quite a lot of Object-Oriented Programming... There are easier ways to make a snake game. But if you want a bit of challenge, you should code it in this way to improve your programming literacy! I struggled to understand it at first too. But thats where the fun part lies. 

Some issues to solve...
1) The button control is not responsive sometimes and that the button must be lifted back up before the next button can be pressed.
2) Add wall to the edges to that the snake dies when it hits the wall.
3) If the snake is moving say to the right, pressing left will cause the snake to die.
